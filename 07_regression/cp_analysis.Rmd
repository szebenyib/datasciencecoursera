```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(gridExtra)
library(reshape)
data(mtcars)
```

#Executive summary

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
